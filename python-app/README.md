# Python Application with Flask and MongoDB

## Overview
This section details the development and containerization process of the Python application with Flask as the web framework and MongoDB for database management. This is part of the larger project focusing on building and deploying a containerized Python application with Flask and MongoDB on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## Project Structure
- **app/**: Directory containing the Python application code.
  - **templates/**: Directory containing HTML templates for the web interface.
  - **static/**: Directory containing CSS and other static files for the web interface.
  - **app.py**: Main Python script for the Flask application.
  - **Dockerfile**: Dockerfile for containerizing the application.

## Steps
1. **Python Application Development**
   - Write a Python script (`app.py`) to perform CRUD operations on the MongoDB database.
   - Utilize Flask framework for web application development.
   - Create HTML templates and static files for the web interface.

2. **Containerization with Docker**
   - Create a Dockerfile (`Dockerfile`) to define the containerization process.
   - Specify dependencies and configurations required for running the Flask application in a Docker container.
